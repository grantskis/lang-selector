# _A Test of Fate: JavaScript Quiz Edition_

### _An HTML website using jQuery, bootstrap, and custom JavaScript and CSS, October 23rd, 2020_

## Description

_"Lang-Selector," or "The Web Knows All...," is is a basic webpage meant to demonstrate knowledge of the building blocks of JavaScript programming. In this page, the user will answer a questionaire with five (5) questions, and at the end be given a decision based on their inputs. Some outputs are hard-locked to specific input answers -- that is, so long as that one answer is chosen, all other output posibilities are discarded -- while other answers contribute to a value range that will produce given results._

## Known Issues / Bugs
- The horizontal width of the initial H1 Jumbotron fluctuates between the quiz and the results "pages" due to presence of scrollbar.
